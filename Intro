This is 5 Months program to be master in Data Structures and Algorithms from noob to professional.
Here I will put my daily updates what I learnt and what problems I faced and how I solved so that It can help you while learning. 

Course material which I will use is MIT Lectures (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb),IITs
lectures provided By NPTEL on Youtube and Gate Lectures by Ravindra Babu.
Books which I am going to use here is Data Structures and Algorithmic Thinking with Python by Narasimha Karumanchi and the other book which 
is the best for this is by Thomas H. Cormen.

Here for first 10 weeks we try to make command on each topic and then going deeper in each topic by solving competative programming and 
coding interview problems on each topic.
